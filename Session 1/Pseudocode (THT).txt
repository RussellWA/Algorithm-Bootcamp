1st Approach
(Binary Search) [O(log(n))]

1. Go to locker sections (1 section = 15 lockers) (30 sections = 450 lockers)
2. Go to middle of locker sections
3. Look at locker numbers
4. If 88 is on current section
5.	Call Found
6. Else if 88 is smaller than numbers in locker sections
7.	Go to middle of left half of locker sections
8.	Go back to line 3
9. Else if 88 is larger than number in locker sections
10.	Go to middle of right half of locker sections 
11.	Go back to line 3
12. Else
13.	End

2nd Approach
(Linear Search) [O(n)]

1. Go to locker sections (1 section = 15 lockers) (30 sections = 450 lockers)
2. Go to first section
3. Look at locker numbers
4. If 88 is on current section
5.	Call Found
6. Else if 88 is not on current section
7.	Go to next section
8.	Go back to line 3
9. Else
